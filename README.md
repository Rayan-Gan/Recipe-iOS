## Recipe-iOS
Add your favourite recipes to have a digital copy of your existing recipe book. This project allows a user to enter a new recipe or edit one of the sample recipes. If the user decides that one of the recipes is no longer relevant, they may remove it.
 
## How to use?
When the user launches the app, a recipe list containing some sample recipes will be displayed. At the top, they can choose to either filter the recipe list by type or add a new recipe to the list. The user can tap on a recipe to view more details about it. In the recipe detail screen, users may edit it to ensure the recipe is complete. When editing a recipe, users can also choose to remove it.
